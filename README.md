# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognizer

## Overview
The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks in the machine learning community. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each with a resolution of 28x28 pixels. The dataset is divided into:
- **Training set**: 60,000 images
- **Test set**: 10,000 images

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three main parts:
1. **Working with Images in Python**
2. **Feature Engineering**
3. **Model Prediction and Evaluation**

### 1. Working with Images in Python
- Understanding grayscale and RGB image representations.
- Using NumPy and Matplotlib for image handling and visualization.
- Preprocessing images for model training.

### 2. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering in images involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to enhance model performance. This is achieved through:
- **Data Augmentation**: Generating new images by applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, and zooming.
- **Normalization**: Scaling pixel values to improve model convergence.
- **Reshaping**: Ensuring image dimensions align with model input requirements.

We will use `ImageDataGenerator` from Keras preprocessing library for data augmentation.

### 3. Model Prediction and Evaluation
- Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Training the model on the MNIST dataset.
- Evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss.
- Visualizing predictions and misclassifications.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras
```

## Running the Project
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Perform feature engineering and augmentation.
3. Train the CNN model.
4. Evaluate and visualize predictions.

Execute the main script:
```bash
python mnist_digit_recognizer.py
```

## Results and Applications
- The trained model can recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy.
- Applications include handwritten document recognition, digit classification in financial systems, and OCR development.
